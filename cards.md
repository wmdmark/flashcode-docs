Cards are code challenges built with JavaScript and Markdown

Here's a breakdown of how each field works to build a problem:

## Instructions
This is where you enter the instructions for how to complete the problem in Github Flavored Markdown.

## Context (optional)
Enter any JavaScript here that is required for the user to complete the problem. For example, if an object called "Car" is required to complete this problem then you might enter something like this:

```js
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}
```

## Initial JavaScript (optional)
Setting JavaScript value here will give the user something to start with. Think of it as a getting started template for the user.

## Solution Validation
This is where you write assertions about the user's solution to validate whether or not they successfully completed the problem.
