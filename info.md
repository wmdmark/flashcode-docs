## Purpose

Flashcode is flash cards for coders. Think of it as a card-sized version of Codecademy or Treehouse.

It's a fun and focused way to:

- **Learn** new JavaScript concepts by playing decks from the library.
- **Teach** and demonstrate JavaScript concepts by building your own decks.

The [Flashcode Challenge Card Engine&trade;](https://github.com/wmdmark/flashcode-docs/blob/master/cards.md) is simple but extremly powerful. With our simple card builder, you can create any kind of JavaScript challenge you can think up using Markdown and JavaScript.
